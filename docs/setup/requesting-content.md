# Requesting Content

You can request new Movies or TV Shows in two ways:

1. Visit [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }}) to make direct requests. These are typically approved within an hour (sometimes longer), and if the content has been released digitally, it will be ready to stream on Plex within 10 minutes. However, an approval does not guarantee content can be retrieved. The process is automated and has rules in place to ensure good quality files. Also, more obscure movies and shows may not be able to be found. The status of requests is sent to my discord including some information on the progress and journey of that request to completion.
2. Add content to your Plex Universal Watchlist, and it will be automatically requested for you.

!!! important
    For the auto-request feature to work with your Watchlist, you must log into [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }}) at least once every 90 days. If you don't log in regularly, the system won't be able to see your Watchlist, and I won't know what content you're waiting for.

!!! note
    It is highly recommended you reach out to me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/401938150877954048) in order to be added to the dedicated server I have set up for **deep.thought**. This will enable you to receive notifications when media is added or when the server is down. It also happens to be the only way to reach out to me directly with questions.
