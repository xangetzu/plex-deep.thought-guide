# Reporting issues

You can report issues for Movies or TV Shows by visiting [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }}). From there, you can find the media you are having trouble with, and report problems with it. The app allows you to select a general topic and write a description. If it is on a show you can report all the way down to a specific episode if the problem is on just one. Like requesting, notifications will be shared via my discord server. 

!!! note
    It is highly recommended you reach out to me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/401938150877954048) in order to be added to the dedicated server I have set up for **deep.thought**. This will enable you to receive notifications when media is added or when the server is down. It also happens to be the only way to reach out to me directly with questions.
