# Managing Newsletter Subscriptions

## Plex's Official Newsletter
New Plex accounts are automatically subscribed to Plex's company newsletter. This is managed by Plex directly and is not controlled by my server. You can unsubscribe from this through your Plex account settings.

## My Weekly Newsletter
I no longer send out a weekly newsletter and instead have pushed all that content onto discord along with other updates on server status and so on.

!!! note
    It is highly recommended you reach out to me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/401938150877954048) in order to be added to the dedicated server I have set up for **deep.thought**. This will enable you to receive notifications when media is added or when the server is down. It also happens to be the only way to reach out to me directly with questions.
