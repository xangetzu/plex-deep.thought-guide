# Changing Plex Streaming Quality

By default, Plex sets video quality to 720p on all new devices. While this conservative setting ensures broad compatibility, it's not optimal for several reasons:

1. Most devices today can handle higher quality streams
2. Downscaling 1080p content to 720p reduces video quality
3. [Transcoding](/docs/faq/what-is-transcoding.md) (converting) video from 1080p to 720p creates unnecessary load on the server

!!! tip
    For the best viewing experience, you should adjust your quality settings to "Maximum" or at least "1080p" if your internet connection can support it. The sections in the table of contents to your left will show you how to do this on different devices.

!!! note
    You'll need to change this setting once for each new Plex app you use (phone, TV, web browser, etc.). After that, the setting will be remembered for that device.
