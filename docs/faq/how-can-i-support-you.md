# Supporting the Server

## Donations
My intent has always been to share with my friends and family. As such I will never ask for any compensation for hosting this. That said, it does cost money and maintenance is no joke. To that end, I have set up a Ko-fi account and you may use that to donate as you see fit. I do have goals for upgrading the physical hardware over time and this would directly contribute to that.

## Plex Pass (Optional)
If you're enjoying Plex, you might want to consider getting a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/). While I don't receive any compensation, it offers several premium features:

* Auto-skip intros and credits
* Access to Live TV
* Unlocked features in [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/)
* And more!

### Plex Pass Subscription Options
- Monthly: Around $5
- **Recommended:** Lifetime subscription
    - Usually $120
    - Often discounted to $80-90 during Black Friday sales
    - Best value if you plan to use Plex long-term

!!! note
    Plex Pass is completely optional - you don't need it to access and enjoy my server's content.
